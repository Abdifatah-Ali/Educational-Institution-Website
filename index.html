					<h4>What Is a Graphic Design School?</h4>
					<p>
						Graphic design, or communication design, is the use of image, text,
						and media to convey information or ideas. Graphic designers are
						strategic communicators who design advertisements, book jackets,
						posters, websites, app interfaces, publishing layouts, album art,
						logos, and so on and so forth. If you’re creative and innovative,
						particularly if you’re also interested in technology, graphic design
						may be a good option for you.
					</p>

					<p>
						To become a professional graphic designer, you’ll need a strong
						portfolio of work to show potential employers, which you could
						theoretically do on your own or by getting an associate degree. But
						if you want a fully fleshed-out college experience, a guaranteed
						strong portfolio, and ready-made industry connections, consider
						getting a BA or BFA in graphic design or communications design (the
						name and specific degree type depends on the school).
					</p>

					<p>
						Graphic design programs can be found both at art schools and as
						departments within larger universities. They're even found at some
						technical schools!
					</p>

					<p>
						This list includes graphic design programs of all types, but all are
						great places to get a graphic design education and to learn the
						skills you need to launch a design career.
