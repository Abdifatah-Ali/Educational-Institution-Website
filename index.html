        <h1>What Is a Graphic Design School?</h1>
        <p>Graphic design, or communication design, is the use of image, text, and media to convey information or ideas. 
        Graphic designers are strategic communicators who design advertisements, book jackets, posters, websites, app interfaces, 
        publishing layouts, album art, logos, and so on and so forth. 
        If you’re creative and innovative, particularly if you’re also interested in technology, graphic design may be a good option for you.</p>

        <p>To become a professional graphic designer, you’ll need a strong portfolio of work to show potential employers, 
        which you could theoretically do on your own or by getting an associate degree. 
        But if you want a fully fleshed-out college experience, a guaranteed strong portfolio, and ready-made industry connections, 
        consider getting a BA or BFA in graphic design or communications design (the name and specific degree type depends on the school).</p>

        <p>Graphic design programs can be found both at art schools and as departments within larger universities. 
        They're even found at some technical schools!</p>

        <p>This list includes graphic design programs of all types, 
        but all are great places to get a graphic design education and to learn the skills you need to launch a design career.</p>
