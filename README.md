# Educational-Institution-Website-GD
This is simple responsive landing page (home page) that has a logo on it. Design, logo and code all by me. 
I created the project for Graphic Design final web project in my college. 
The project was to just practice logo making skills, and also to enhance my HMTL&CSS knowledge.
Unfortunately, this simple page is not responsive yet, I will work on it and update the files soon to make it mobile friendly. 
Any suggestions to make the project better are appreicated.
